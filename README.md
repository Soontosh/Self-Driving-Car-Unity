### Procedural Generation
*Procedural Generation, Click for Compilation of Images*

The procedural generation makes use of a modified [Lindenmeyer System](https://www1.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e28_3/lsys.html).  
Structures are disabled for performance reasons.  

### A* Grid
Utilizes tree-searching for efficiency. A* Grid is sized dynamically according to road network size.  

### Demonstrator

*Demonstrator in Action*

Uses the A* Algorithm in tandem with a semi-realistic car controller I made to automatically drive car from point A to point B.  
Saves demonstration to file, which can then be used to train model.

## Google Sites Presentation
This was a project I made for my science project in 8th grade. I used google sites to present the project.  
I apologize if the presentation is not in-depth, I had to keep it short and make it understandable to people who didn't know how to code. I only showed simple code and a very broad outline of the project.
